  "transcript": "Speaker 0: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 1: Lisa, good afternoon. My name is Mark. I'm with the health enrollment agency. We're just responding to your application regarding health insurance. Was that for yourself or for the family?\n\nSpeaker 0: For the family. Three of us.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. And that's in the state of let me have a look here. Michigan.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha. Michigan.\n\nSpeaker 1: And are you guys currently insured?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: What carrier do you guys have?\n\nSpeaker 0: Shit. Shit. I don't remember.\n\nSpeaker 0: Is it through, like, a job or state insurance? It's through my husband's job, and he just lost his job. So\n\nSpeaker 1: I gotcha. So it's it came it's coming to an end, or it already came to an end?\n\nSpeaker 0: It's it's came to an end. We're COBRA ing.\n\nSpeaker 1: I hear you. And did you guys receive an offer from COBRA?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. It was ridiculous.\n\nSpeaker 1: It always is. How much was it?\n\nSpeaker 1: $3 a month. Oof. Pretty steep here for you. Does anybody have any preexisting health conditions or anything like that?\n\nSpeaker 0: I have multiple sclerosis.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And I'm fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: And any medications for the family that are brand name specialty?\n\nSpeaker 0: The only thing my husband is on is Lipitor, and it has nothing to do with his heart. It just has to do with the\n\nSpeaker 0: he apparently\n\nSpeaker 0: has a tendency to clot. I've\n\nSpeaker 0: I hear you. But she doesn't have any\n\nSpeaker 0: he has low blood pressure. We've all all of us.\n\nSpeaker 0: Low blood pressure,\n\nSpeaker 0: low cholesterol,\n\nSpeaker 0: low a one c. We're very healthy. We exercise daily. We just got back from our two mile walk.\n\nSpeaker 0: So\n\nSpeaker 1: Awesome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So no ongoing treatments, therapy, surgeries either?\n\nSpeaker 1: Nope. Awesome.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what's the expected annual income of the household before taxes?\n\nSpeaker 1: I know it is a little bit weird. He has come in between jobs. Thousand.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, he's got a new job, but the I wanna see what\n\nSpeaker 0: they don't wanna pay for health benefits for the family.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, no.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. Yeah. Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 0: So we we need benefits.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'll explain a little bit on what we're gonna do here. We're gonna do a search within the Michigan Insurance database for all your family's qualifying options.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's gonna happen is that given that everybody's in pretty much perfect health, you guys are gonna qualify for a ton, which is a good thing. On one hand, the most affordable options in Michigan, we wanna be a little bit careful with because they're not guaranteed to cover everything just right off the bat. Right?\n\nSpeaker 1: They either start taking off the coverages to lower the monthly premium or they start raising that deductible. On the other hand, you guys would also qualify for, hypothetically, the top tier also in in Michigan.\n\nSpeaker 1: Somewhere along the lines\n\nSpeaker 1: of 4 figures per month too as well just like your COBRA, but that doesn't per se mean that you guys wanna be paying that. Right? So what we do is that we apply a maximum price filter for that monthly premium so the system's only pulling what's realistically considerable for you. What would you say that number you guys don't wanna exceed for a monthly premium?\n\nSpeaker 0: Don't wanna exceed?\n\nSpeaker 0: Correct. I don't wanna exceed anything.\n\nSpeaker 0: Don't wanna exceed\n\nSpeaker 0: I I would hope not to have to exceed,\n\nSpeaker 0: 600.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Let me see what I can do for you guys here. And\n\nSpeaker 1: when would you guys need that coverage effective?\n\nSpeaker 0: November 1.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. And if I'm able to find you guys a policy\n\nSpeaker 1: that makes sense coverage wise and price wise, would you guys be able to make a choice here today?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Give me one second, Lisa. I'm gonna put you on a brief hold. I'll be right back. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, ma'am. Are you with me? Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I have some great news for you. Based on the information that you provided, you and your family actually qualify for one of the better live rate that I've seen here today. But before we get too ahead of ourselves, I just wanted to go over the name of the insurance and also what it covers for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So Okay. Policy is gonna be with Paramount.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's an open access plan, so you can go ahead and take this policy anywhere. No restrictions on this doctor you guys can or can't do. If you guys don't worry, you guys don't have to put your current doctors if you guys don't want to.\n\nSpeaker 1: Does that make sense?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. Awesome. And you'll receive coverage as stated on the policy. Unlimited\n\nSpeaker 1: primary and specialist visits, those will be a flat low pays as well, 25 per primary, 50 per specialist.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll also receive\n\nSpeaker 1: diagnostic testing for blood and lab work, double sided prescription coverage for generic and brand name medications.\n\nSpeaker 1: Preventative procedures are all covered at a 100%. For example, like your x rays, MRI, CAT scans, etcetera.\n\nSpeaker 1: You will also receive structured into the policy dental, vision, hearing,\n\nSpeaker 1: medical, surgical, hospitalization,\n\nSpeaker 1: and emergency room coverage as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can take this policy anywhere in the country because of its nature, so you can take it outside\n\nSpeaker 1: of the state of Michigan if need be.\n\nSpeaker 1: No referrals to see a specialist is ever required from a client. For example, like a OBGYN,\n\nSpeaker 1: you don't need a referral to go ahead and see that specialist,\n\nSpeaker 1: and your family qualifies for no deductible.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's first aid for special care.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's full vision, hearing, medications, hospitalizations,\n\nSpeaker 1: etcetera.\n\nSpeaker 1: I did just wanna it does sound like the coverage that you're looking for before we go over the numbers and everything. So how did that sound for you so far? Do you have any questions?\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, so far so good.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the monthly premium is coming in at $5.10 and 56\u00a2. I'm assuming that'd be affordable for you guys?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Awesome. And I have some more great news. Just one more thing to go over with you.\n\nSpeaker 1: There is a one time enrollment fee that you pay for the first month's bill and the first month's bill only. It's typically $1.25.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now we're able to cut your family a break here and get you guys qualified for a hardship on that enrollment fee, bringing it down to $27.50.\n\nSpeaker 1: So your first month's bill is still under $5.50.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'd be looking at $5.38\n\nSpeaker 1: and 6\u00a2 to start. I'm assuming that'd be affordable today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Alright. Let's get you guys approved so you guys can see everything in black and white here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. Would you like to be the primary on the policy, Lisa?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright.\n\nSpeaker 1: Lisa is common spelling,\n\nSpeaker 1: l I s a?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: K.\n\nSpeaker 1: Last name is Stanton?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes. S t a n c o n. Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 1: And do you have a middle initial that you'd like to reflect on the insurance card?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. And I can have this policy affected by midnight tonight. Does that work with you guys?\n\nSpeaker 0: I actually don't need it effective until\n\nSpeaker 1: this on November 1. November 1? I apologize for that. Let me go ahead and correct that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. So with the first monthly payment here today, you wouldn't have to worry about another one until December 1. Does that make sense? Okay. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright.\n\nSpeaker 1: And is this still a good address for you guys? I have\n\nSpeaker 1: 3290\n\nSpeaker 1: East Breckenridge Lane?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: And is that a house or apartment?\n\nSpeaker 0: It's a house.\n\nSpeaker 1: K.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's in Bloomfield Hills?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright.\n\nSpeaker 1: Michigan.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's 48301\n\nSpeaker 1: for the ZIP. Right?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can run that through the system. Awesome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Would you like to have this phone number on file in case the insurance carrier has further questions?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have 248797248797.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then last four is 1 621?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have access to this email address? I have 3stantons@gmail.com?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. That's where your temporary insurance cards are gonna be sent today for you and the rest of the family. You can use those in the meantime\n\nSpeaker 1: because the hard copies are gonna take one to three weeks typically after the effective date. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. That's fine. We don't need them for months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright.\n\nSpeaker 1: And\n\nSpeaker 1: date of birth is 10/13/1968?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 0: And\n\nSpeaker 1: '6 October 13. Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 1: 10/13/1968.\n\nSpeaker 1: Awesome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Let's go ahead and add\n\nSpeaker 1: your dependents onto the policy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your spouse, do you guys share the same last name?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. And what's the correct spelling of his first\n\nSpeaker 0: or her first? James, j a m e s. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright.\n\nSpeaker 1: And his date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 0: O two,\n\nSpeaker 0: 01/06/1967.\n\nSpeaker 1: 1967.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. And how many kids are there? Just one? Just one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Stanton as well?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 0: Michael.\n\nSpeaker 1: M I c h a e l?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: And his date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 0: 08/2009.\n\nSpeaker 1: O eight.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the day?\n\nSpeaker 0: 02/2009.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha. 02/2009.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Awesome. Let me just make sure all the t's are crossed and i's are dotted before we go over the sensitive information on the app.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi. Awesome, Lisa. I'm gonna go ahead and pause the live recording on the call here for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: K.\n\nSpeaker 1: Continue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Awesome, Lisa. I'm ready for you. Whenever you're ready, because I do hear some background noise in there. Please verify that you're in a safe place to do so. And whenever you're ready, go ahead with your full nine number social.\n\nSpeaker 0: 382-90-5125.\n\nSpeaker 1: I did just wanna confirm the first three and the last four. First three was 382 and last four is 5135.\n\nSpeaker 0: 380.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. 382. You're right. 382.\n\nSpeaker 0: My bad.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. I'll repeat that after you with your permission. Can I do it? Yeah. Yeah. 3 82905135?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Awesome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. And for the billing information, is that a credit or a debit?\n\nSpeaker 0: Do I have to do that right now?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, ma'am. But you're gonna receive documentation\n\nSpeaker 1: while we're on the phone, and you'll be billed when you sign off on that document, if that makes sense. Not right now.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm really not in the spot to do that right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: I hear you. Do you have\n\nSpeaker 1: a date where the funds are gonna be available? I can possibly get it pushed out a little bit for you.\n\nSpeaker 0: I have the funds available. I'm just not in the position. I'm at the grocery store.\n\nSpeaker 1: I hear you. I hear you.\n\nSpeaker 0: Spilling out that information.\n\nSpeaker 1: I hear you. Give me one second here. I'm gonna see what I can do about getting this pushed out for you. Okay, Lisa?\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, Lisa. Are you with me?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, unfortunately, with this specific carrier, they're not letting me push it through without the billing information\n\nSpeaker 1: first on file. They need it for the consideration\n\nSpeaker 0: of the premium. So I apologize for somebody to assist yet. You need a credit card. Right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright. Hang on. Let me go to that place where I can do this.\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright. You ready?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me pause that live recording for you really quick.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, Lisa. Ready whenever you are.\n\nSpeaker 0: 4100\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 0: 390322003037.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the expiration in CVV?\n\nSpeaker 0: 02/1962.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Alright. It is coming across as an invalid number. I'm gonna repeat it back to you so you don't have to do anything on your part.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. It's gonna it's gonna be 4100\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: 3903\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: 2200\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: 3037?\n\nSpeaker 0: Nope. 3837.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright. I won't get too free.\n\nSpeaker 1: Go ahead and see if you're approved. If you are, you should be receiving a text message here shortly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Awesome. So it says sent here on my end. That means you were approved, Lisa. Go ahead and check your text messages, and let me know when you see it. It should be from First Enroll, my member benefits.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Awesome. Is that link open?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Awesome. So you should see the terms and conditions there, which are just gonna be the legalities over the policy and the bill by benefits breakdown.\n\nSpeaker 1: Don't worry. You'll be able to download this document\n\nSpeaker 1: too as well so you can have a look at it later too with your husband or whoever that may be.\n\nSpeaker 1: As far as the terms and conditions go, there's gonna be two big ones that'll apply to the insured directly. One is gonna be the twelve and twelve preexisting clause, which states that anything diagnosed within the last twelve months, such as cancer, stroke, heart attack, etcetera,\n\nSpeaker 1: would have a twelve month waiting period to be covered. But you guys weren't diagnosed with anything major within the last twelve months. Correct? No. That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Awesome. So that doesn't apply to you or the family whatsoever.\n\nSpeaker 1: Obviously, anything from this point moving forward\n\nSpeaker 1: or more specifically, November 1 moving forward would have the coverage.\n\nSpeaker 1: God forbid, though. Right?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Awesome. The next thing is just a disclaimer that this is not an Obamacare or ACA policy. This is a private PPO plan, meaning that it has two restrictions on the PPO.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the this is a open access.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a PPO.\n\nSpeaker 1: I apologize. That's that's\n\nSpeaker 1: force of habit here because we do have a lot of PPO policies available in the state of Michigan.\n\nSpeaker 1: I apologize.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's an open access plan with Paramount. You should see that there too as well. I apologize.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm not familiar with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what happens is that it has two restrictions and only two restrictions, Lisa. It's not gonna cover a mental health issue, and it's not gonna cover a substance abuse issue. So unless anybody in the family needed to go to a rehab center or a psych ward, you guys are all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. Yeah. That's not a problem. Awesome, Lisa. So the next thing, I just wanted you to make sure that all the information in there is correct. If everything looks good, you can go ahead and sign off on that policy. And if you have any questions whatsoever, I'll still be able to hear you. So just shout. Okay? Okay. I I do have a question. Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. What do I do with it?\n\nSpeaker 0: What if I wanna cancel it before it starts?\n\nSpeaker 1: Like, if I sign this now, are we am I signing up for it? I mean, then what what are we doing here? So what happens is with this postdated payment, it kind of stretches out your grace period. Right? Because with any insurance policy that you get enrolled into, let's say, if we were to do the effective date today, you will still have a thirty day revision period to go ahead. And when you cancel within those thirty days, you will receive a full first month's refund. Now since it's Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Postdated,\n\nSpeaker 1: that kinda extends it for you.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So because\n\nSpeaker 0: okay. So I can cancel it?\n\nSpeaker 0: Correct. Like, if in two weeks I find something better, I can cancel it? Correct.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I just wanna do it. Alright. So now I need to sign it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct. Let me know when it says successfully signed this document.\n\nSpeaker 0: It's Paramount?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct. It's the open access policy with Paramount.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So who's covered in that? Like, what?\n\nSpeaker 0: You\n\nSpeaker 0: and your No. No. No. I mean, where can we go?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's an open access plan. So there's no restrictions on which doctors you can or can't see, and you guys don't have to switch your current doctors.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Don't have to switch your current doctors. And how much is the office visit?\n\nSpeaker 1: $25\n\nSpeaker 1: to see a primary, 50 for a specialist or urgent care.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: And I don't have to switch doctors?\n\nSpeaker 1: Don't have to switch doctors. It's almost like a PPO\n\nSpeaker 1: because a PPO has,\n\nSpeaker 1: wider accessibility than, for example, a HMO,\n\nSpeaker 1: but an open access means open access. So there is no out of network doctors or hospitals with an open access\n\nSpeaker 0: plan. Oh, okay. And we could go out of state, use it out of state? Nationwide.\n\nSpeaker 0: Nationwide. Okay. What about out of country? Not No. I mean, I gotta ask. Okay. No problem?\n\nSpeaker 0: No no\n\nSpeaker 1: can't work. No little problem. It's just in The United States.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. No. Alright. That's I gotta clarify.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. No problem.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So if we go to Canada, which is down the street, we just gotta hop back on the car and get over to The US.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Essentially. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I mean,\n\nSpeaker 0: Windsor is ten seconds down the street.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Then I just need to look.\n\nSpeaker 0: And then you're gonna email all this to me? Correct. Today, you'll receive\n\nSpeaker 1: those temporary insurance cards, a welcome email, as well as a member portal. In that member portal, you guys can access the details of this policy at any time and make changes also to your personal information. For example, like that billing,\n\nSpeaker 1: address, or contact if it would ever change.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Alright. Because all I have to do is hit it stop, and I'm done.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 0: So that's why I'm asking all these questions before. It's okay. It's my job to answer them.\n\nSpeaker 0: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 0: Or as you would say, awesome.\n\nSpeaker 0: Sorry.\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright.\n\nSpeaker 0: Then\n\nSpeaker 0: I hit it stop.\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright. There should be some acknowledgments. Did you check those off too as well? Yes. Yeah. It says completed. You have to successfully sign the document. Alright. Give me one second. My friend. Gotcha. Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you want, you can jump ahead and kinda open up the notes app on your iPhone. I'll have some important numbers for you to take down once I submit your signature here on my end. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 0: Notes to take down?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct. I'll have your member ID, which is the policy number for lack of a better term, and then I'll give you the customer service. After that, you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me one second here. Second. Yeah. No problem. I haven't received it on my end either. It's taking a little while. Okay. Because I got\n\nSpeaker 0: I'll be right back. I gotta get a bigger cart. Yeah. No problem.\n\nSpeaker 0: I I'm just getting a cart and call me back.\n\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm I told you I heard the grocery store.\n\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate you seeing me. Alright. I'm back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Awesome. So it successfully went through perfect timing.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have your member ID ready when you are.\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright. Hold up.\n\nSpeaker 0: Pen.\n\nSpeaker 0: Paper. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. It's gonna be 685417.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh-huh. 634.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'll repeat that one more time. 6854\n\nSpeaker 0: It's 85417\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm. 634.\n\nSpeaker 1: Awesome. And then I also wanted to give you the customer service as well. Let me pull that up for this specific policy too as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's gonna be 877\n\nSpeaker 0: Wait. Hang on. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: 877.\n\nSpeaker 1: One second here. 877.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gosh. Why is she being slow with me today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh-huh. 541-0783.\n\nSpeaker 0: 0783.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Awesome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you have any other questions for me, Lisa?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, sir. Other than that, you're also company?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct. You should be receiving that in about five to ten minutes if you haven't received it already. Alright, Lisa? Okay. Thank you. Thank you. If anything comes up, do not hesitate to call that customer service number, and you've been a pleasure today. Okay? You're all set. Oh, thanks. You too. You've been,\n\nSpeaker 0: awesome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much, Lisa. You too. You made my day.\n\nSpeaker 0: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Bye bye.",
