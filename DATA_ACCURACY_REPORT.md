# Data Accuracy Investigation Report - SyncedUpCallAI

**Date**: December 16, 2024
**Issue**: Analytics and Calls pages showing inaccurate/incomplete data
**Status**: Investigation Complete - Issues Identified

## Executive Summary

The analytics and calls pages are technically functioning but displaying severely incomplete data due to:
1. **97.3% missing critical data fields** (agent names, phone numbers, timestamps)
2. **55,744 out of 57,282 calls lack start times** (97.3%)
3. **Only 1,538 calls have complete timestamp data** (2.7%)
4. **Recent data concentrated in September 2024** with gaps in current data

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Database Has Data But It's Mostly Incomplete

**Total Records**: 57,282 calls exist in the database

**Data Quality Issues**:
- **99.98% missing agent names** (57,270 out of 57,282)
- **99.99% missing phone numbers** (57,278 out of 57,282)
- **97.3% missing start times** (55,744 out of 57,282)
- **97.3% missing durations** (55,745 out of 57,282)

### 2. Data Distribution Problems

**Date Distribution** (Recent 5 days with data):
```
September 16, 2024: 5 calls
September 15, 2024: 3 calls
September 13, 2024: 2 calls
September 12, 2024: 1,526 calls (bulk import)
September 10, 2024: 2 calls
```

**Key Issue**: The bulk of data (1,526 calls) is from a single day (Sept 12), suggesting a one-time import rather than continuous data collection.

### 3. Data Sources Mismatch

The system has multiple data sources that aren't properly synchronized:
- **Direct webhook data**: Often missing required fields
- **Convoso integration**: Partial data capture
- **Manual imports**: Bulk data without proper field mapping

**Sample Recent Calls Shows**:
```
ID: 32b6a570... | Source: convoso | Start: NULL | Duration: NULL | Agent: "Agent Smith"
ID: 30b70cd7... | Source: convoso | Start: Valid | Duration: NULL | Agent: "John Agent"
ID: c634c442... | Source: convoso | Start: NULL | Duration: NULL | Agent: "Test Agent"
ID: 0def870f... | Source: webhook | Start: NULL | Duration: NULL | Agent: NULL
ID: e7de0d70... | Source: webhook | Start: NULL | Duration: NULL | Agent: NULL
```

### 4. API Endpoints Are Working But Return Incomplete Data

**`/api/admin/calls-simple`**:
- ✅ Authentication working
- ✅ Query executes successfully
- ⚠️ Returns data with mostly NULL values
- ⚠️ JOIN operations on agents/contacts tables not finding matches

**`/api/admin/analytics`**:
- ✅ Aggregation logic is correct
- ⚠️ Calculations based on incomplete data
- ⚠️ Date filters working but filtering mostly empty datasets

### 5. Root Causes Identified

1. **Webhook Integration Issues**:
   - Webhooks creating call records without essential fields
   - No validation ensuring required fields are populated
   - Webhook payload structure doesn't match database schema

2. **Data Import Problems**:
   - Bulk imports missing field mappings
   - No data validation during import process
   - Historical data imported without timestamps

3. **Integration Synchronization**:
   - Convoso integration capturing partial data
   - Agent and contact lookups failing (orphaned foreign keys)
   - Metadata field contains data but isn't being extracted properly

## Impact on User Experience

### Analytics Page (`/admin/analytics`)
- **Call totals**: Showing 57,282 but most lack context
- **Duration metrics**: Inaccurate (97% missing)
- **Agent performance**: Can't calculate (no agent data)
- **Time-based trends**: Broken (no timestamps)

### Calls Page (`/admin/calls`)
- **List displays**: Mostly empty rows
- **Filtering**: Non-functional (filtering NULL values)
- **Search**: Can't find calls (no searchable data)
- **Date ranges**: Misleading (97% undated)

## Data Pipeline Analysis

```
Webhook → Database → API → Frontend
   ↓         ↓         ↓       ↓
[BROKEN] [INCOMPLETE] [PASS] [DISPLAY]

- Webhook: Not capturing/sending required fields
- Database: Storing incomplete records
- API: Correctly querying incomplete data
- Frontend: Accurately displaying the incomplete data
```

## Recommendations (Investigation Only - No Fixes Applied)

### Critical Actions Needed:
1. **Fix webhook payload processing** to capture all required fields
2. **Add data validation** at database insert level
3. **Implement data recovery** for existing 57,282 records
4. **Create monitoring** for data completeness

### Data Recovery Strategy:
1. Query Convoso API to backfill missing data
2. Parse metadata JSON fields for phone numbers
3. Match orphaned agent_ids with agents table
4. Set default timestamps for historical records

### Prevention Measures:
1. Add NOT NULL constraints on critical fields
2. Implement webhook payload validation
3. Create data quality monitoring dashboard
4. Add automated alerts for incomplete records

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Issues Found:
- `calls` table allows NULL for critical business fields
- No CHECK constraints ensuring data validity
- Foreign key relationships not enforced (orphaned records)

### Query Performance:
- Queries execute successfully
- JOINs finding few matches due to orphaned keys
- Indexes present but ineffective with NULL-heavy columns

---

## Conclusion

The system architecture is sound, but data quality is severely compromised. The pages are accurately displaying what's in the database - the problem is that 97%+ of the data is incomplete or missing critical fields. This is primarily a data ingestion and validation issue, not a display or query problem.

**Next Steps**: Implement data validation at the webhook/import layer, backfill existing records, and add monitoring to prevent future data quality degradation.
