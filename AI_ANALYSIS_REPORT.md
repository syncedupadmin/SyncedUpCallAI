# AI Analysis Report - SyncedUp Call AI System

## Executive Summary
The SyncedUp Call AI system performs sophisticated multi-stage analysis of sales calls using state-of-the-art AI models for transcription and analysis. The system is specifically designed for health insurance sales call optimization.

## 1. Transcription Layer

### Primary Service: Deepgram Nova-2
- **Model**: Nova-2 (latest Deepgram model)
- **Features Enabled**:
  - Speaker diarization (identifies different speakers)
  - Language detection (auto-detects language)
  - Smart formatting (adds punctuation, capitalizes)
  - Paragraphs (groups into logical paragraphs)
  - Utterances (segments by speaker turns)
  - Word-level timestamps

### Fallback Service: AssemblyAI
- Automatic failover if Deepgram fails
- Similar feature set for redundancy

### Translation Service
- **Model**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- Automatically translates non-English calls to English
- Preserves original text alongside translation

## 2. Analysis Layer

### Primary Analysis Model: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- **Temperature**: 0.2 (consistent, deterministic outputs)
- **Response Format**: Structured JSON

### Fallback Model: Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Activates if OpenAI fails or returns invalid data
- More sophisticated reasoning capabilities

## 3. What the AI Analyzes

### A. Call Classification
The AI categorizes calls into 12 primary reasons:

1. **pricing** - Cost concerns or comparisons
2. **duplicate_policy** - Customer already has coverage
3. **spouse_approval** - Needs partner's consent
4. **bank_decline** - Payment processing issues
5. **benefits_confusion** - Doesn't understand coverage
6. **trust_scam_fear** - Suspects fraud/scam
7. **already_covered** - Has existing insurance
8. **agent_miscommunication** - Agent error or confusion
9. **followup_never_received** - Missing promised callbacks
10. **requested_callback** - Wants to be contacted later
11. **requested_cancel** - Wants to cancel policy
12. **other** - Doesn't fit categories above

### B. Quality Metrics

#### QA Score (0-100)
Evaluates agent performance on:
- Professionalism
- Clarity of communication
- Objection handling
- Regulatory compliance

#### Script Adherence (0-100)
Measures how well agent follows:
- Proper greeting
- Needs assessment
- Product explanation
- Closing techniques

### C. Sentiment Analysis

#### Agent Sentiment (-1 to +1)
- Negative: Frustrated, impatient, dismissive
- Neutral: Professional, balanced
- Positive: Enthusiastic, helpful, engaged

#### Customer Sentiment (-1 to +1)
- Negative: Angry, confused, resistant
- Neutral: Undecided, listening
- Positive: Interested, satisfied, eager

### D. Risk Detection

The AI flags high-risk situations:
- **at_risk** - Customer likely to churn
- **payment_issue** - Problems with payment processing
- **confused** - Doesn't understand product/pricing
- **unhappy** - Dissatisfied with service
- **callback_needed** - Requires urgent follow-up

### Special Rule: Easy At-Risk Detection
Automatically flags calls as "at_risk_easy" when:
- Reason is bank_decline, trust_scam_fear, or spouse_approval
- AND QA score is below 60%

### E. Key Information Extraction

#### Summary
- 40-word maximum description of call outcome
- Captures essential result and next steps

#### Key Quotes
- 2-4 verbatim customer quotes
- Includes timestamps (MM:SS format)
- Focuses on sentiment-revealing statements

#### Confidence Score (0-1)
- AI's confidence in its classification
- Higher scores indicate clearer call patterns

## 4. Advanced Features

### Opening Pattern Analysis
Separate ML system that:
- Analyzes first 30 seconds of successful calls
- Identifies winning opening phrases
- Calculates success rates for different approaches
- Tracks conversion rates by opening style

### Embedding Generation
