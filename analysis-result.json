With the Health enrollment center. We respond to that case you submit for health insurance. You're just looking for yourself or for the family today? Oh, just myself. Okay.

And when you did have coverage July 31, who is your carrier through?\n\nSpeaker 1: Trustmark SB. It was through my employer. Your employer? Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 0: Alrighty. Now I'm gonna go over a few medical questions with you so that we can find the best coverage for you. How old are you? Mhmm. I am 62.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes, ma'am. And do you have any preexisting conditions?\n\nSpeaker 1: I do. I have blood pressure,\n\nSpeaker 0: and that's basically it. I got I had cancer 12 years ago. Yes, ma'am. And do you take any prescriptions at all monthly, weekly, or daily? Yes. I do. Okay. Just a high blood pressure medication? Yes. Yes, ma'am. Now I'm gonna see if you qualify for any credits in the state of New Jersey. What is your expected household income for the year? They do look at the gross income before taxes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, just myself right now, I'm unemployed,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'm only\n\nSpeaker 1: so I think I have a total let me see. Hold on. Yes, ma'am. 28.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you mean monthly?\n\nSpeaker 0: So I can calculate your monthly, but it's expected for the year. So what do you think that overall, which you would have made for the year? At least 50,000.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And then is it just you and the household, or do you have any dependents or married at all? No. I have a roommate. Yes, ma'am. And on a month to month basis, what's the affordable price range you would like to stay in to pay for your health coverage?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh my god. The littlest possible because I I'm on unemployment, like I said. And and when did you need your coverage to become effective?\n\nSpeaker 0: I if you had it today, that would be great. Mhmm. So I can the quickest I can get you is by midnight tonight. Okay? Okay. That's great. Yes, ma'am. Let me see what's out here for you. When I come back online, we'll be able to go over your benefits, and then we can get you squared away. Okay, miss Janet? Alright. Thank you. You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Hello, miss Janet? Yeah. Hi. Hi. Thank you so much for holding. Your company? So we're a brokerage company. This is the health enrollment center here. We work with every major carrier nationwide.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. I gotcha. Yes, ma'am. So I was looking over all the options that you do have here, still Cigna\n\nSpeaker 0: New Jersey. Now because the last time you had insurance was in July, you're over your 30 day free look fee, like, your 60 days for your No. Blue. So you when you lose coverage, you have 60 days to regain coverage. When you do not regain the coverage in the 60 days, the government considers that to be a voluntary loss of coverage. Okay? Uh-huh. So the way that we can get you some form of health, you have to be through the private market. Alright? Now through the private market, there is plans here. Now\n\nSpeaker 0: you guys are the First Health PPO network, which is holding off the city of Aetna. So you'll still be verified by the nature of your name that you can trust. This plan has no annual deductible, so you will receive first dollar coverage and is a PPO plan. Okay? On a month to month basis for you, the plan will be $2.91.\n\nSpeaker 0: Are you familiar with the differences between HMO plans and PPO plans?\n\nSpeaker 0: I know. Blue can you tell me that 1 more time what that is? Yes, ma'am. So HMO is a health maintenance organization, and people prefer provider organization. Those are the 2 umbrellas that insurances fall under. Okay? So with HMO plans, they're referral based. That means anytime you go to see a specialist or you get your lab work done, you will have to have a referral. Also, with HMO plans, you can only go to the doctors or facilities that they tell you to. Now PPO plan, which is what you and I are going over, is the opposite of what a HMO is. That means you don't have to stop your treatment to wait for an authorization or pay for 2 visits just for 1 situation. Also, PPO plans allow you that ability to see in and out of network doctors. You don't have to worry about not being able to go to the doctor or facility that you wanna go to and or utilize. Okay? Now this plan is in a group access period, which is similar to you getting the insurance to an employer. What that means is that the program is normally reserved for your groups and businesses of a thousand or more members. However, because of the association membership that's available right here in New Jersey, that's why you still Anthem submit the application for approval even after open enrollment. Okay? So Okay. With the plan, there are 3 things. So the private market, they don't cover 3 things, and I'm legally obligated to let you know. So the 3 things are pregnancy,\n\nSpeaker 0: substance abuse, or inpatient psychiatric treatment. Do you think any of those 3 things are needed?\n\nSpeaker 0: So you It would've Health what what were the 3 things again? I'm sorry. You're okay. So the 3 things that they do not cover are pregnancy\n\nSpeaker 0: Uh-huh. No. Substance abuse,\n\nSpeaker 0: and inpatient psychiatric treatment. Okay. Now go. No. No. Okay. Now what you would yes, ma'am. Now what you would receive coverage for is your doctor's visits,\n\nSpeaker 0: prescription,\n\nSpeaker 0: diagnostic testing, and lab work, emergency, surgery, and hospital stays, and that's all with no annual deductible. So you'll receive that first dollar coverage. I'll take you to how a doctor visit will go for you. Your preventive care will be free of charge, you know, as your yearly checkup. If you continue to go to the PCP throughout the year, there'll be a $25 co pay. If any emergency occurs, it'll be a $50 co pay, like, going to urgent care to see a specialist. Okay? That's that's $50 co pay for you. Now your telehealth is free. Are you familiar with how telehealth works? Yes. I am. Okay. So telehealth is free of charge. I always tell people, especially after you you do your yearly checkup, if you only try to get your prescriptions, use the telehealth. It's free of charge. No maximum how many times you can utilize it. And, also, you do have Conley Humana in there, which is 24 7 access to therapy. Whether it's 2, 3, 04:00 in the morning, you'll be able to use the Conley Human, and it's free of charge as well because it does come along with the plan. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 0: Now with that, the plan on a monthly basis for you will be $2.91. There is a onetime non repeating enrollment fee of $50.\n\nSpeaker 0: That enrollment fee guarantees you a few things. It guarantees that the plan will be accepted nationwide, so you do not only have to have coverage right here in New Jersey, but you do have coverage throughout the whole United States. It also guarantees that the plan will be on a month to month basis. So you're not in a contractual plan. You can keep the plan for as little as long as you like. And lastly, it guarantees that your monthly rate will be locked in until you're 65 and eligible for Medicare. Ultimately, what that is saying is you don't have to worry about price increases. Okay? A lot of times carriers, they do like to raise the rate on you. But while you are placed into the plan, they would never raise it on you. Okay? And then when you do turn 65, we do help you here with your Medicare supplements as well.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, you do? Okay. Yes, ma'am. Now is this something that's doable for you so we can submit your application for approval and get you squared away?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Let's see. What what what prices, though? So the plan is $2.91.\n\nSpeaker 1: A a month? Yes, ma'am. Oh, wow. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the lowest you have.\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright. Yeah. With the because right now, you're not receiving any subsidized rate\n\nSpeaker 0: because of the voluntary loss of coverage that the government considers you to have. It would have been cheaper?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. If you would have. So when you lost coverage, if you would have came within the the 60 days, then they could have given you a subsidized rate.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.

So I have here your first name is Jeanette. The spelling is j e n n e t t e. Last name is Hernandez. It's h e r n a n d e z. Is that correct spelling of your first and last name? That's correct. Okay. Did you want a middle initial on your ID card or no? No. It's e, but I don't have to have it. Yes, ma'am. And what you will be receiving your physical cards in the mail is the mailing address of 4 Hummingbird Lane, Manchester Township, New Jersey 08759.\n\nSpeaker 0: And then the email address where you will be receiving your digital cards to the email is your last name, yourfirstname60@gmail.com.\n\nSpeaker 0: So it's hernandezjanette60@gmail.com.\n\nSpeaker 0: Is that accurate? That is correct. Perfect. And then I do have your date of birth as 09/21/1963.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now That is correct. Miss Jeanette, my tone may change because I do have to do certain things for compliance reasons. So just keep that in mind. Okay? Please keep in mind that we are on a recorded line. For security purposes, to the best of your knowledge, everything we've gone over today regarding your preexisting conditions, your medications, your ongoing treatments, and therapies is accurate and true. Is that correct? That is correct. Perfect. Now we can submit your application for approval. To secure your approval, did you wanna utilize a Visa or a Mastercard?\n\nSpeaker 1: We are going to use my\n\nSpeaker 0: Mastercard. If it's a Master, it should start with a 5. You can go ahead with the card number whenever you're ready.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on 1 second. Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 1: I gotta get my glasses.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 0: I understand. I'm legally Molina. So to Really? Yes, ma'am. I have my eyesight as negative 7.5.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh my god. Yeah. So yes, ma'am. Wearing contact lenses? Yeah. I wear contacts. Yes, ma'am. Wow. I'm just just grateful that I have First name again? My name is Liz. Liz. Now let me tell you, Liz. Mhmm. Should I be shopping this around and trying to get a low rate? Well, here we work with every major carrier. Now what I can pick so I'm able to look over your all your options. Now what I can tell you is that I would have been able to give you the lower rate. Now what we can do as far as lowering your rate is we can wait for next year when open enrollment comes back around, and then we can find you a subsidized rate at that time. Okay? When Cigna year, you're saying? No. So it'll be next year. So come come back in January so you'll have your coverage for January 2026, and then we'll be able to And, hopefully, I'll be working by then. That's Yes, ma'am. The key thing. Yes, ma'am. And then we'll be able to kinda lower that rate for you and get this subsidized since you are a past your Blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. I gotcha. I should've done this a while ago. But at least moving forward,\n\nSpeaker 1: I can get some coverage. Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So let's start with the card. #######.\n\nSpeaker 0: And the card expiration date?\n\nSpeaker 1: It is 12/28.\n\nSpeaker 0: I do not need the CVV. Is your card information the same as your member information? Your first name, last name, and Anthem ZIP code of 08759?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes. Okay. And can you verify your social?\n\nSpeaker 1: 583-43-2582.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm sending over your esignature documents now. Okay, miss Jeanette? When you do receive this, make sure I did my job correctly, and I have your first name, last name, the address, and the email address as all spelled accurately. It's a text message from manage.first enroll. You should just receive that there. You can place me on speaker, and I can guide you through the app.\n\nSpeaker 0: So just respond? Yes. It's a text link for you. Yes, ma'am. Click on that, and then you should see your member information there. Make sure that your name is spelled correctly, the address is accurate, and then your email.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's gonna be $2.91 and $50?\n\nSpeaker 0: So that's just your the first time. That's the 1 time non repeat enrollment fee, the $50. That gives you those guarantees that I was telling you about, which is guarantees that your plan would never go up. So as long as you stay into the plan, they would never raise that rate on you. It also guarantees that it's a month to month program. So let's say you only need this for 3 months, then you wanna cancel that because you have your job coverage\n\nSpeaker 0: and you get into, then you'll be able to cancel that out with no penalties. Okay? So there's no cancellation fee. And then it also guarantees that the plan will be nationwide. So you don't only have country in New Jersey. If you New York or go to Texas, you will be covered there as well.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Does it do you have any international coverage? So if this is a PPO plan, you'll be able to utilize it there. It's just with international coverage that give you out of network benefit.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I got you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright.\n\nSpeaker 1: So\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm gonna do this, I guess. Yep. Yes, ma'am. Now if everything there is spelled correctly, miss Jeanette, what you'll be able to do is you can take your finger, scroll all the way down to the very bottom. Sign it. Yes, ma'am. Now do you have a pen and piece of paper? I wanna give you a few numbers. I'm a start with your customer service number. I'm able to give you your member ID as well. I can't connect to the Wi Fi number. You might wanna check the connection number. God. She's talking to me. The customer service. Is that\n\nSpeaker 0: the the Google Google. Yeah. Voice mail.\n\nSpeaker 0: But I haven't set it up yet, so it's still Oh, she's like, oh, are you talking to me? What's going on? I know. I'm kinda mom so I bought my mom the iRobot.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you know\n\nSpeaker 0: so, you know so they move, but it scares me because I'll go there, and sometimes it'll just start talking. I'm like, uh-uh. So I haven't got this.\n\nSpeaker 0: I was scared. I was like, uh-uh.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh my god. Yeah. So so First get this done. And did you when you went to sign Cigna and you Cross accept, did you see the green portion that popped up there that says you successfully cleared Cigna signature? Yep. It still does get on my end.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep. So now I'm gonna download documents. Yes, ma'am. You'll be able to download documents. Okay. Probably just loading. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: I got it. There it is. I'm submitting your application now. It is going to do medical underwriting, and I will let you know if you are approved for the plan.\n\nSpeaker 0: If approval, then that's when I'll have your member ID. Okay? And you were approved, miss Jeanette. So I do have those numbers for you. Just let me know when you're ready for them. Okay? Okay. Customer service insurance. Yes, ma'am. Insurance name Aetna? Yes, ma'am. Okay. So Anthem number is 855\n\nSpeaker 0: Uh-huh. 513\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm. 5676.\n\nSpeaker 0: Again, that customer service number is (855)\n\nSpeaker 0: 513-5676.\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright? My name is Liz, l I z, and my extension is 803. You know, I'll be your licensed agent on record from here on out. Okay? If you wanna come back to me doing open enrollment as well, I'm gonna give you my direct line so you can do so. Okay? So my direct line is 855\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm. 616\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm. 4011.\n\nSpeaker 0: And then I have your member ID. Okay? That member ID for you is #######.\n\nSpeaker 0: 173.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm. Again, that's #######.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now, miss Jeanette, I've already submitted everything to the carrier where it belongs. We do not keep your information here. We will not call you to ask you for your information. So if anyone's confused enough for information, do not give it out. No card number, social, any of that because it's already where it needs to be. Okay? You are covered by Midnight. You have emergency and prescription coverage. There is a waiting period for any doctor scheduling.\n\nSpeaker 0: So just do that. And if you have any other doctors, just call the customer service number, and you can place them on file as well. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Very good. Alright. Okay, Liz. Thank you so much for your help. Miss Jeanette. I hope you enjoy. You have a blessed day. You too. God bless.","segments":[{"speaker":"agent","startMs":800,"endMs":12180,"text":"Good morning, miss. With the Health enrollment center. We respond to that case you submit for health insurance.

Blue can you tell me that 1 more time what that is? Yes, ma'am. So HMO is a health maintenance organization, and people prefer provider organization. Those are the 2 umbrellas that insurances fall under. Okay? So with HMO plans, they're referral based. That means anytime you go to see a specialist or you get your lab work done, you will have to have a referral. Also, with HMO plans, you can only go to the doctors or facilities that they tell you to. Now PPO plan, which is what you and I are going over, is the opposite of what a HMO is. That means you don't have to stop your treatment to wait for an authorization or pay for 2 visits just for 1 situation. Also, PPO plans allow you that ability to see in and out of network doctors. You don't have to worry about not being able to go to the doctor or facility that you wanna go to and or utilize. Okay? Now this plan is in a group access period, which is similar to you getting the insurance to an employer. What that means is that the program is normally reserved for your groups and businesses of a thousand or more members. However, because of the association membership that's available right here in New Jersey, that's why you still Anthem submit the application for approval even after open enrollment. Okay? So Okay.

And lastly, it guarantees that your monthly rate will be locked in until you're 65 and eligible for Medicare. Ultimately, what that is saying is you don't have to worry about price increases. Okay?
